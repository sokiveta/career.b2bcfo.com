    <p class="text-xl">"How do I find clients?" is usually the first question CFOs ask about joining our firm. We have the answer to that question, which is supported by our Partners collecting more than $350MM since 2008. We provide 40+ hours of business development training in the first six weeks of someone joining our firm. <br />
    <br />
    We provide a Mentor who is a successful Partner who gives one-on-one weekly training (via Zoom) for the first six months. This training reinforces our initial training and then teaches advanced business development and client service training. We also provide a full-time Business Development Coach who has 25+ years of direct business development experience. This Coach is available any time a Partner wants to improve their skills and/or has questions.<br />
    <br />
    Our internal Certified Business Transition Expert&trade; training is taught by a Partner who has closed 20+ transactions, an attorney and a key person from Morgan Stanley. This training will prepare you when a business owner wants to sell or transfer their business and/or to acquire another company. <br />
    <br />
    Training and professional development is enhanced by our Regional Leaders, peer professionals, forum communications, annual meetings, periodic training by our sponsors, etc. </p>
