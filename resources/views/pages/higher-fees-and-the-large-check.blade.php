	<h2>Higher Fees &amp; The Large Check</h2>
</div>

<div class="col-lg-6">
	<p>Our income philosophy is from the adage, "Give a person a fish and the person will eat for a day. Teach a person to fish and the person will eat for a lifetime." <br />
	<br />
	Some "perceived" competitors (Fractional CFO firms) tell people they will provide leads. We know who they are and what they do. They either (1) give "job board" leads, which causes their people to make cold-calls to HR departments or (2) find clients and keeps 50% to 75% of bill rates. As an example, a current Partner in our firm worked for a Fractional CFO firm who found a client. They billed the client $15,000 a week and paid her $4,000 each week. This went on for several months until she found our firm and was excited about our philosophy of finding clients and keeping more money than she did previously with the "perceived" competitor. <br />
	<br />
	Our "secret sauce" is to have business owners pay us high hourly fees plus six-figure checks. Our process and people allow us to charge a higher hourly rate than "Fractional CFOs," who might charge between $75 to $125 an hour. We teach our Partners how to charge $250 to $350 an hour. Using our "secret sauce", for the same amount of billable time, our Partners can earn an additional $120,000-$180,000 annually.<br />
	<br />
	Our largest check so far in our B2B Exit<sup>&reg;</sup> work is $350,000. (One Partner closed a deal in 2021 and earned an average of $650 an hour.) It's not unusual to see our Partners receive six-figure checks in addition to their hourly fees. We have created a business niche in this area with our strategic direction, which includes our books, patented software, internal training, recruiting, relationships with M&amp;A Advisors, our law firms who help our Partners with support on their Agreements, NDAs, etc.</p>
