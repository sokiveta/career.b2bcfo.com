                        2. Limitation on Non-Disclosure Agreement. The aforesaid obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to any part of the Company Information Prospective Member can prove by clear and convincing evidence:<br /><br />

                        a. was already in Prospective Member's possession before disclosure;<br /><br />

                        b. was or has become publicly available through no fault of Prospective Member;<br /><br />

                        c. was lawfully obtained from any party, other than the Company or any of the Company's Members, who was legally authorized to hold and disclose such Company Information; or<br /><br />

                        d. was independently discovered without the benefit of any information disclosed by the Company.<br /><br />

                        3. Return of Company Information. All Company Information disclosed by the Company to Prospective Member shall be and shall remain the property of the Company.

                        5. No Additional Obligations. Nothing herein contained shall obligate either the Company to admit Prospective Member as a Member of the Company or Prospective Member to become a Member of the Company.<br /><br />

                        6. No License. Nothing herein shall be construed as granting to Prospective Member any interest or license under any trade secret, know-how, trademark or any copyright of the Company that the Company now has or subsequently obtains.<br /><br />
